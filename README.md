# ObjectComparator

## Overview

ObjectComparator is a high-performance .NET library crafted meticulously for deep comparisons between objects. Beyond just pointing out the disparities, it delves into the depths of objects, reflecting even the minutest differences. Furthermore, it arms developers with the capability to prescribe custom comparison rules tailored for specific properties or fields.


## Key Features
- **Deep Comparisons:** Unravel every detail and identify even the slightest differences between complex objects.
- **Custom Rules:** Define bespoke comparison criteria for distinct properties or fields, ensuring you have full control over the comparison process.
- **High Performance:** Despite the comprehensive nature of its comparisons, ObjectComparator stands out due to its blazing speed.

## Usage

### Basic Comparison

Compare two `Student` objects and identify the differences.

```csharp
         var actual = new Student
            {
                Name = "Alex",
                Age = 20,
                Vehicle = new Vehicle
                {
                    Model = "Audi"
                },
                Courses = new[]
                {
                    new Course
                    {
                        Name = "Math",
                        Duration = TimeSpan.FromHours(4)
                    },
                    new Course
                    {
                        Name = "Liter",
                        Duration = TimeSpan.FromHours(4)
                    }
                }
            };

            var expected = new Student
            {
                Name = "Bob",
                Age = 20,
                Vehicle = new Vehicle
                {
                    Model = "Opel"
                },
                Courses = new[]
                {
                    new Course
                    {
                        Name = "Math",
                        Duration = TimeSpan.FromHours(3)
                    },
                    new Course
                    {
                        Name = "Literature",
                        Duration = TimeSpan.FromHours(4)
                    }
                }
            };
                
               var result = actual.DeeplyEquals(expected); 
	       
	/*   
	    Path: "Student.Name":
	    Expected Value :Alex
	    Actually Value :Bob
    
	    Path: "Student.Vehicle.Model":
	    Expected Value :Audi
	    Actually Value :Opel
    
	    Path: "Student.Courses[0].Duration":
	    Expected Value :04:00:00
	    Actually Value :03:00:00
    
	    Path: "Student.Courses[1].Name":
	    Expected Value :Liter
	    Actually Value :Literature 
	*/
	    
```

  ### Custom Strategies for Comparison
  
  Define specific strategies for comparing properties.
   
```csharp
         var result = actual.DeeplyEquals(expected,
                strategy => strategy
                    .Set(x => x.Vehicle.Model, (act, exp) => act.Length == exp.Length)
                    .Set(x => x.Courses[1].Name, (act, exp) => act.StartsWith('L') && exp.StartsWith('L')));  
		    
        /* 
            Path: "Student.Name":
            Expected Value :Alex
            Actually Value :Bob
            
            Path: "Student.Courses[0].Duration":
            Expected Value :04:00:00
            Actually Value :03:00:00
        */
    
  ```

### Ignoring Specific Properties or Fields

   Omit certain properties or fields from the comparison.

```csharp

    var ignore = new[] {"Name", "Courses", "Vehicle" };
    var result = actual.DeeplyEquals(expected,ignore);
   
     /*
     	Objects are deeply equal
    */
    
```

### Display Distinctions with Custom Strategy

   Provide specific strategies and display the differences.
   
```csharp

     var result = actual.DeeplyEquals(expected,
                strategy => strategy
                    .Set(x => x.Vehicle.Model, (act, exp) => act.StartsWith('A') && exp.StartsWith('A')), "Name", "Courses");
		    
    /*
		Path: "Student.Vehicle.Model":
		Expected Value :Audi
		Actually Value :Opel
		Details : (act:(Audi), exp:(Opel)) => (act:(Audi).StartsWith(A) AndAlso exp:(Opel).StartsWith(A))
    */
    
    var skip = new[] {"Vehicle", "Name", "Courses[1].Name"};
            var result = expected.DeeplyEquals(actual,
                str => str.Set(x => x.Courses[0].Duration, (act, exp) => act > TimeSpan.FromHours(3),
                    new Display {Expected = "Expected that Duration should be more that 3 hours"}), skip);
		    
    /*	    
		Path: "Student.Courses[0].Duration":
		Expected Value :Expected that Duration should be more that 3 hours
		Actually Value :04:00:00
		Details : (act:(03:00:00), exp:(04:00:00)) => (act:(03:00:00) > 03:00:00)
   */
  
```

### Comparison for Dictionary Types

Identify differences between two dictionary objects.

```csharp

    var expected = new Library
            {
                Books = new Dictionary<string, Book>
                {
                    ["hobbit"] = new Book {Pages = 1000, Text = "hobbit Text"},
                    ["murder in orient express"] = new Book {Pages = 500, Text = "murder in orient express Text"},
                    ["Shantaram"] = new Book {Pages = 500, Text = "Shantaram Text"}
                }
            };

            var actual = new Library
            {
                Books = new Dictionary<string, Book>
                {
                    ["hobbit"] = new Book {Pages = 1, Text = "hobbit Text"},
                    ["murder in orient express"] = new Book {Pages = 500, Text = "murder in orient express Text1"},
                    ["Shantaram"] = new Book {Pages = 500, Text = "Shantaram Text"},
		    ["Shantaram1"] = new() { Pages = 500, Text = "Shantaram Text" }
                }
            };

            var result = expected.DeeplyEquals(actual);
	    
    /*
		Path: "Library.Books":
		Expected Value: 
		Actual Value: Shantaram1
		Details: Added
		
		Path: "Library.Books[hobbit].Pages":
		Expected Value: 1000
		Actual Value: 1
		
		Path: "Library.Books[murder in orient express].Text":
		Expected Value: murder in orient express Text
		Actual Value: murder in orient express Text1
   */
  
```

### Ignore Strategy

Apply a strategy to ignore certain comparisons based on conditions.

```csharp

     var act = new Student
            {
                Name = "StudentName",
                Age = 1,
                Courses = new[]
                {
                    new Course
                    {
                        Name = "CourseName"
                    }
                }
            };

      var exp = new Student
            {
                Name = "StudentName1",
                Age = 1,
                Courses = new[]
                {
                    new Course
                    {
                        Name = "CourseName1"
                    }
                }
            };

            var distinctions = act.DeeplyEquals(exp, propName => propName.EndsWith("Name"));
    /*
     	Objects are deeply equal
    */
    
```	

### DeeplyEquals if type(not primities and not Anonymous Type) has Overridden Equals method

```csharp

            var actual = new SomeTest("A");
            var expected = new SomeTest("B");
			
			var result = exp.DeeplyEquals(act);
			
	/*
		Path: "SomeTest":
		Expected Value :ObjectsComparator.Tests.SomeTest
		Actually Value :ObjectsComparator.Tests.SomeTest
		Details : Was used override 'Equals()'
	*/
	
```	

### DeeplyEquals if type has Overridden Equality  method

```csharp		
	/*	
		Path: "SomeTest":
		Expected Value :ObjectsComparator.Tests.SomeTest
		Actually Value :ObjectsComparator.Tests.SomeTest
		Details : == (Equality Operator)
	*/
```	

### Display distinctions for Dictionary type
	
```csharp
	var firstDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>
            {
                {"Key", "Value"},
                {"AnotherKey", "Value"},
            };

        var secondDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>
            {
                {"Key", "Value"},
                {"AnotherKey", "AnotherValue"},
            };
			
	var result = firstDictionary.DeeplyEquals(secondDictionary)
			 
			 
	/*	
		Path: "Dictionary<String, String>[AnotherKey]":
		Expected Value :Value
		Actually Value :AnotherValue
	*/
	
```				

### Comparison for Anonymous Types

Detect differences when dealing with anonymous types.
		
```csharp
            var actual = new {Integer = 1, String = "Test", Nested = new byte[] {1, 2, 3}};
	    var expected = new {Integer = 1, String = "Test", Nested = new byte[] {1, 2, 4}};
			
	    var result = exp.DeeplyEquals(act);
			
	/*
		Path: "AnonymousType<Int32, String, Byte[]>.Nested[2]":
		Expected Value :3
		Actually Value :4
	*/
                
```
